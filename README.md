# SimpleWeatherStation
## Physical Device SW for Iot sample solution, build with a DHT22 sensor, connected to a Feather Huzzah ESP8633.
The code for this simple weather station is used to demonstrate connecting a physical device to an IoT Central App. The code is available in different releases (that are all supported by the Iot Central App). Each new release gets more features. The project's name reflects the initial release, because the original idea was to store releases in their own repository, identified by a release number. However, it is easier to just make use of GitHub releases and extend the existing app with new functionality. More on how to connect the device to the IoT Central App can be found in [this document](DeviceDescription.md).
